            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a first year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://learning-systems.org/">Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems</a> (CLS), jointly advised by Prof. <a href="https://mrtz.org" Moritz Hardt</a> and Prof. <a href="https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/niaohe">Niao He</a>. I obtained my master's degree at D-INFK of <a href="https://ethz.ch/de.html">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a> and my bachelor's degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences
            at the <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China</a> (USTC). </p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and social science. I am broadly interested in deepening the understanding of complex systems using tools from optimization, reinforcement learning, control theory, and network science. 
                Currently, I'm also learning tools in causal inference. Before that, I worked on control and optimization during my master's studies.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p> I grew up in an energetic and beautiful city, Wuhan in China. When I am not working or studying, I am a big fan of table tennis, and enjoy playing many other sports. Animated movies are always my first choice when going to the cinema. A dog person in every sense.</p>
